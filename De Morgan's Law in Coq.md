I’ve been playing around with the Coq proof assistant using the book [Software Foundations by Pierce et all](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/index.html "Software Foundations by Pierce et all"). In the first chapter, the book authors kick off our journey through the system by introducing the basics of Coq – inductive types, definitions, and tactics such as destruct and reflexive – in the context of boolean values and natural numbers.
