On Monday 7th September 2015, Trinidad and Tobago held its 13th general elections since becoming a nation independent from Great Britain. The election resulted in the incumbent ruling coalition of the UNC, COP, and TOP being ousted from government, with the PNM securing the reigns of the nation for the next five years.

Every election generates interesting data painting a picture of the electorate and their decisions. On Thursday 10th December 2015, the Election and Boundaries Commission released the [detailed results of Monday’s elections](http://www.ebctt.com/wp-content/uploads/Results-of-the-Parliamentary-Election-Held-on-Monday-7th-September-2015.xlsx) on their [website](http://www.ebctt.com/data/). I haven’t played around with Pandas for a while, so I thought munging the xls file housing the data might be a nice way to re-familiarise myself with Pandas and the other statistical libraries popular amongst Pythonistas.
