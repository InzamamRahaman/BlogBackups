A Little over a year ago, a lecturer and cherished mentor of mine provided me space on his server to run a wordpress blog. The [blog](http://kyledef.org/inzamam)'s initially served as a notepad for me to jot down some simple notes on some of the work I did during my time with the AgriNet project. I only blogged twice about said work, leaving out some of the other work we did on data visualisation.
