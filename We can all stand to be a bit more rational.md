Recently while scrolling through my Facebook feed, I saw a post by a friend linking to what [appears to be a letter to the editor of the Trinidad Express ](http://www.trinidadexpress.com/20150806/editorial/tt-needs-to-be-more-godless). Behind the unnecessary snark and callousness of the piece lies a thesis I can agree with – I do believe that Trinidad and Tobago would benefit from a more secularised mindset. With every religious holiday, I face-palm after hearing some cleric rant on the evening news about Trinbagonian society’s woes are due to people not coming to church or due to our children not being force-fed particular religious dogma. That being said, I think the article suffers from some logical inadequacies and seems more like a rant than a cogent argument.
