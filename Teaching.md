<h2>Formally</h2>

Currently, I tutor for the Department of Computing and Information Technology at The University of the West Indies, St Augustine. This involved conducting the tutorials and preparing some materials for the following courses:

* INFO 2415 - Enterprise Database Systems
* COMP 2700 - Database Management Systems I
* COMP 3150 - Computer Networks
* COMP 3550 - Internet Technologies.

In addition, during my penultimate undergrad year, some other students and myself staffed a help desk oriented towards helping level 1 CS students at an individual level.

<h2>Informally</h2>

I was an active member of the UWI Computing Society and the UWI Jammers, and by virtue of my affiliation with them, both during my undergrad and after, have conducted several tutorials on topics such as functional programming in F#, LaTeX, and the graph database Neo4j. 

Together with one of my lecturers, I also conducted a series of sessions on functional programming in Racket, using the SICP as the "textbook".

Moreover, I was a mentor at the CoderDojo run by UWI in concert with Digicel in 2013.
