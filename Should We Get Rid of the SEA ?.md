The 2015-2016 school year is now in full swing here in Trinidad and Tobago. The little tikes who cried and screamed and clutched their parents while being dropped off for pre-school have probably settled down, hopefully making friends. The latest batch of secondary school entrants, lodged in the awkward place betwixt childhood and adolescence's trials, would have settled into their new station. I don't teach year 1s at my university, but I haven't been asked for the location of the Maths or CS departments' locations for about two weeks - the new students are feeling more at home in UWI's halls. 

There is another group of young people, who, in general, have not left or entered into a new school, but have likewise crossed into a new paradigm of existence. Who you ask ? Those kids, who by the methodology of the primary school they attend, who have started preparations for the Secondary Entrance Assessment.  

The Secondary Entrance Assessment (SEA) is the Trinbagonian equivalent of the British Common Entrance Examination. Back in the days of colonialism, secondary school was not universally sponsored by the state. The only way to formally obtain a secondary education was to excel at the Common Entrance exam in order to be sponsored by the state. Eventually, we became independent and universally sponsored primary and secondary education became a critical component of our Caribbean democracy. However, the Common Entrance exam remained an integral fixture in our education system.
